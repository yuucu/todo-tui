# [FEATURE] Implement Release Drafter with Semantic Versioning

## 📝 Feature Description
Implement automated release management using GitHub's Release Drafter with semantic versioning to streamline the release process and maintain consistent version numbering.

## 🎯 Problem to Solve
Currently, the project lacks automated release management, which means:
- Manual release creation is time-consuming and error-prone
- Version numbering might be inconsistent
- Release notes need to be written manually
- No standardized process for determining version bumps (major/minor/patch)

## 💡 Proposed Solution
Implement Release Drafter with the following components:

### 1. GitHub Actions Workflow
Create `.github/workflows/release-drafter.yml` that:
- Runs on every push to main branch
- Automatically updates draft release based on PRs
- Uses semantic versioning rules

### 2. Release Drafter Configuration
Create `.github/release-drafter.yml` with:
- Automatic categorization of changes (Features, Bug Fixes, Documentation, etc.)
- Semantic versioning rules based on PR labels
- Template for release notes generation

### 3. PR Labeling Strategy
Implement labels for semantic versioning:
- `major`: Breaking changes (bump major version)
- `minor`: New features (bump minor version) 
- `patch`: Bug fixes (bump patch version)
- `skip-changelog`: Changes that don't affect releases

### 4. Version Tagging
- Automatic version tag creation when release is published
- Follow semantic versioning (e.g., v1.2.3)
- Integration with Go module versioning

## 🔄 Alternatives Considered
1. **Manual releases**: Continue current approach (not scalable)
2. **Conventional Commits**: Use commit message parsing (less flexible than PR labels)
3. **GitHub's Auto-generated release notes**: Basic but lacks semantic versioning

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Release Drafter GitHub Action is configured and working
- [ ] Draft releases are automatically created/updated on main branch pushes
- [ ] Release notes are automatically categorized by change type
- [ ] Semantic versioning is implemented based on PR labels
- [ ] Labels are documented in contributing guidelines
- [ ] Version tags follow semantic versioning format
- [ ] Integration with Go module versioning works correctly
- [ ] Documentation is updated with release process

## 📱 Additional Context
### Example Release Drafter Configuration Structure:
```yaml
name-template: 'v$RESOLVED_VERSION'
tag-template: 'v$RESOLVED_VERSION'
categories:
  - title: '🚀 Features'
    labels:
      - 'feature'
      - 'enhancement'
  - title: '🐛 Bug Fixes'
    labels:
      - 'fix'
      - 'bugfix'
      - 'bug'
```

### Semantic Versioning Rules:
- **Major**: Breaking changes that require user action
- **Minor**: New features that are backward compatible
- **Patch**: Bug fixes and minor improvements

## 🏷️ Priority
- [x] Medium (should be addressed soon)
